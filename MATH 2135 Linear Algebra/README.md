# MATH 2135 Linear Algebra

This course is a continutation of MATH 1030 with an emphasis on foundations and the theory of vector spaces and linear transformations. Additional topics include inner product spaces, symmetric and orthogonal transformations, bilinear forms, similarity and diagonalization, the solution of linear differential equations, and various applications in mathematics, physics and computer science.

*Pre-requisites*: MATH 1030 (Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra I) and MATH 1000 (Differential and Integral Calculus I)

*Exclusions*: MATH 2040 (Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra II)
