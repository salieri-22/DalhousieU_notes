# CSCI/MATH 2113 Discrete Structures II

This class continues the exploration of discrete mathematics started in Discrete Structures I. It aims to further develop logical reasoning skills which are important to computer science and mathematics. Elementary counting techniques lead to sophisticated methods to approach combinatorial problems. These methods include bijective, counting, and discrete probability. Structures such as partitions, permutations, symmetry groups, graphs and trees are introduced. Finally, discrete principles are applied to computation, transmission, and correction of digital information.
